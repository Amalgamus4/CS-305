# CS-305 Software Security


    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a client that specializes in financial services for its clients. They were seeking to increase the security and integrity of their long-term storage and data transimssion services.

    
    What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
When I found vulnerabilities, I documented them and then formed a mititgation plan to eliminate or reduce the risk they posed. It is important to code securely for many reasons, such as maintaining reliable systems,
ensuring data integrity, and securing sensitive information. Software security enhances the trust that a company's clients have in that company. If the company's code was subject to attacks due to software vulnerabilities,
it would erode the clients' trust and potentially cause harm to both the clients and the company.

    
    Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I found interpreting the static test results challenging, as there were so many flagged vulnerabilities, I was unsure how best to handle them. However, by methodically reading through each risk and taking time to understand
how each one functioned, I was able to make a plan to mitigate the vulnerabilities and suppress the false positives.

    
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
While not actually put into practice during this course, I learned that security can be added through many different means, such as input validation, secure data structures, and proper configuration of APIs. In the future,
I plan to employ static and dynamic testing to assess vulnerabilities. The mitigation techniques used against these vulnerabilities would really depend on the risk found.

    
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
By employing the various methods learned throughout this course, I was able to make the code and software application functional and secure. I conducted a code review to look for any possible vulnerabilities, ran static checks
to look for dependency issues, and finally did a functional test of the code to ensure it worked as expected.

    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The dependency checker was a very valuable tool that helped to realize just how vulnerable even simple applications can be. I plan to use this in my future assignments, along with other secure coding practices I learned in this course.

    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The uploaded Project 2 artifact would be a good example of work I have done to show a potential employer. It showcases not only my understanding of secure coding, but also my ability to document a project and communicate effectively.
